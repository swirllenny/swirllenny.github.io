<center> Welcome to my website! I'm swirllenny, a programmer that codes with HTML/CSS, Python, JavaScript, Ruby, C and C++. I made many enviorments in different game editors. Now you may be asking in your head, who is swirllenny? I am an internet person that just catches on the relavent memes and do some magic and make it a dead meme. That's how the internet works. But really, I code many things and I surround coding. I coded ever since I was 15 and made my first internet game. My parents didn't believe I owned it, so I showed them the code. By the second I did, their jaws dropped. They crowned me as the "Family Coder" ever since. </center>

<center> I always had a reputation for coding, I was intrested. My brother is a game designer, and I thought to myself 'It looks really fun, but it looks like you need effort.' I studied what he knew and it was relieving to see everything work. I then studied more languages and to the point I actually did it everyday whenever I could. My brother then started Skyping with me (Discord wasn't around yet.) and telling me how awesome my projects were. I always loved coding when I introduced myself, and I remember saying to myself over and over "it never gets old." </center>
